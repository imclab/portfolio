				<h2>PHP web programming and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>LAMP, neural networks, research papers</p>
				<p>I was hired as an Analyst/Programmer at Verkko Stadi during the summer. Initially I worked on their dating site, <a href="http://www.ittakes2.com/">Ittakes2.com</a>. I was later assigned to the creation of a visual pattern matcher.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I had to analyze the pattern recognition problem and present a working solution.</li>
					<li>I read several research papers from relevant journals of the IEEE.</li>
					<li>I learned the mathematics of image processing.</li>
					<li>I implemented a solution proposed by a particularly interesting paper that proposed the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_context">Shape Contexts</a>.</li>
					<li>I coded the algorithm in C++ using OpenCV and made informed decisions about data structures.</li>
					<li>I acquired an understanding of neural networks. I learned the mathematical theory behind them.</li>
					<li>The final solution was a <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">convolutional neural network</a> I built with Lush.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the summer of 2007.<p>

				<h2>Compiler construction</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>JIT compilation, Common Lisp, Open source</p>
				<p>In 2007, I started working on a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler for the open source <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clisp">CLisp Virtual Machine</a>. I started development on my own because I wanted to make CLisp faster. I am now an official member of the CLisp team.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>CLisp is over 600k LOC. It is one of the most used Lisp compilers.</li>
					<li>I read several research papers from relevant journals of the IEEE.</li>
					<li>I learned the various transformations that exist to optimize code.</li>
					<li>Debugging the dynamically generated code was a real challenge. Especially in the presence of exceptions, tag-bodies, unwinds...</li>
					<li>I had to generate machine code that balanced low-level concerns like cache pressure, register pressure and branch prediction.</li>
					<li>As of winter 2008, the compiler is functional and in beta.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the autumn of 2007. Development is ongoing.<p>

				<h2>Web application design</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>Django, Usability, Startups</p>
				<p>I developed a full featured dating website for a company I co-founded. We believed we could provide a better service because we understood how to make common use cases natural. The result is <a href="http://www.newstart4love.com/">Newstart4love.com</a>.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I wanted this to be an introduction to the world of startups.</li>
					<li>I met weekly with my associate to assess progress and establish new tasks for the following week.</li>
					<li>We collaborated with a web designer for the graphical design.</li>
					<li>I wrote unit tests for all relevant functions.</li>
					<li>We used direct and indirect feedback from our end-users to help our decision making.</li>
					<li>I designed the interface to ease the common usage scenarios.</li>
					<li>I love Django.</li>
					<li>I returned to school at the end of the summer.</li>

				<h2>Web application design with Ajax</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>Ajax, Django, Usability</p>
				<p>I implemented <a href="http://www.karmajoy.com/">Karmajoy.com</a> following an <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2008/08/random-acts-of-kindness-a-social-site-id-love-to-see/">idea</a> formulated by Leo Babauta. The idea was to help people help people. I liked it right away so I set out to create the application.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I implemented everything myself.</li>
					<li>I enhanced the interface with Ajax through JQuery.</li>
					<li>The website implements tagging.</li>
					<li>The website implements threaded comments.</li>
					<li>The website implements private messages.</li>
					<li>The website implements search.</li>
					<li>The website provides complex relations between entities to help browsing.</li>
					<li>The website implements a karma system.</li>

				<h2>Genetic programming</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>Algorithms, Image processing, Creativity</p>
				<p>I was amazed by a <a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">post</a> written by Roger Alsing. He had made an algorithm that could reproduce images using a limited amount of semi-transparent polygons. I wanted to make my own.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The original's source code wasn't available at the time.</li>
					<li>I started by a prototype using Numpy. It didn't converge.</li>
					<li>I <a href="http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/master">re-implemented it in Java</a>. It started converging.</li>
					<li>I gradually improved and added genetic operators based on my analysis of the problem.</li>
					<li>I <a href="http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/gp">re-implemented the algorithm</a> to use genetic programming.</li>
					<li>I read other people's take on the problem.</li>
					<li>I <a href="http://github.com/ynd/mona-clojure/tree/master">re-implemented it in Clojure</a> as the evolution of lambdas and <a href="http://npcontemplation.blogspot.com/2009/01/clojure-genetic-mona-lisa-problem-in.html">blogged about it</a>.</li>

				<h2>Robot programming</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>Micro-controllers, low-level programming, electric circuits</p>
				<p>This was my first year project at university. We had to build and program a robot to perform a diverse set of tasks. We were given total freedom in our implementation and in the management of our time.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>No master classes. We relied on the micro-controller's specification.</li>
					<li>Deep understanding of the hardware. Knowledge of the timing charts, diagrams of the components and control registers.</li>
					<li>The robot could play music, follow intricate lines, detect nearby objects and escape from mazes, among other things.</li>
					<li>No operating system. We built a realtime cooperative multitasking scheduler in order to process the data from our various sensors.</li>
					<li>The robot was built from a kit (similar to Arduino).</li>
					<li>Winner of the Philip and Lily Malouf prize for passion and excellence.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the winter semester of 2007.<p>

				<h2>Game design</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>OpenGL, Java Swing, Design patterns</p>
				<p>This was my second year project in university. We built a pinball game. At the beginning of the semester, we received the specification of a game we had to finish by ourselves by the end of the semester.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>We designed the architecture balancing diverse concerns.</li>
					<li>We used MVC. The model layer would be implemented by a C++ DLL and the View/Controller would be in Java.</li>
					<li>I understand the OpenGL pipeline.</li>
					<li>We implemented realistic physics.</li>
					<li>We implemented an editor that would allow the creation of game tables.</li>
					<li>My team was composed of 5 people.</li>

				<h2>Hardware MP3 player</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>FPGA, low-level programming, VHDL</p>
				<p>This was my third year project in university. We had a semester to build a system running on an FPGA that could download music from a distant server, decode and play it.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>We had to be able to download, decode and play MP3s in realtime.</li>
					<li>We had to communicate with a distant TCP server.</li>
					<li>We had total control over the hardware architecture. We could add and remove hardware components at will (memory, buses, timers, caches, etc).</li>
					<li>We had to implement and integrate a few hardware components ourselves using VHDL.</li>
					<li>We understood the system down to it's lowest level in VHDL. For instance, we read the VHDL of an AC97.</li>
					<li>We used 2 microblaze soft cores in our architecture. We programmed them using C.</li>
					<li>We wrote drivers for our own components so that they could be used in C by the microblazes.</li>
					<li>We achieved realtime through precise measurements and optimizations.</li>
					<li>My team was composed of 4 people.</li>
