				<h2>Yann's Portfolio</h2>
				<p>I am passionate student in computer engineering. I enjoy solving problems. I have a focus on creating tools for people using my knowledge of web programming, algorithms and systems programming.<p>

				<h2>Robot programming</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>Micro-controllers, low-level programming, electric circuits</p>
				<p>This was my first year project at university. We had to build and program a robot to perform a diverse set of tasks. We were given total freedom in our implementation and in the management of our time.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>No master classes. We relied on the micro-controller's specification.</li>
					<li>Deep understanding of the hardware. Knowledge of the timing charts, diagrams of the components and control registers.</li>
					<li>The robot could play music, follow intricate lines, detect nearby objects and escape from mazes, among other things.</li>
					<li>No operating system. We built a realtime cooperative multitasking scheduler in order to process the data from our various sensors.</li>
					<li>The robot was built from a kit (similar to Arduino).</li>
					<li>Winner of the Philip and Lily Malouf prize for passion and excellence.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the winter semester of 2007.<p>

				<h2>PHP web programming and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>LAMP, neural networks, research papers</p>
				<p>I was hired as an Analyst/Programmer at Verkko Stadi during the summer. Initially, I worked on their dating site, <a href="http://www.ittakes2.com/">Ittakes2.com</a>. I was later assigned to the creation of a visual pattern matcher.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I had to analyze the pattern recognition problem and present a working solution.</li>
					<li>I read several research papers from relevant journals of the IEEE.</li>
					<li>I learned the mathematics of image processing.</li>
					<li>I implemented a solution proposed by a particularly interesting paper that proposed the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_context">Shape Contexts</a>.</li>
					<li>I coded the algorithm in C++ using OpenCV and made informed decisions about data structures.</li>
					<li>I acquired an understanding of neural networks. I learned the mathematical theory behind them.</li>
					<li>The final solution was a <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">convolutional neural network</a> I built with Lush.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the summer of 2007.<p>

				<h2>Compiler construction</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>JIT compilation, Common Lisp, research papers</p>
				<p>In 2007, I started working on a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler for the open source CLisp Virtual Machine. I started development on my own because I wanted to make CLisp faster. I am now an official member of the CLisp team.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>CLisp is over 600k LOC. It is one of the most used Lisp compilers.</li>
					<li>I read several research papers from relevant journals of the IEEE.</li>
					<li>I learned the various transformations that exist to optimize code.</li>
					<li>Debugging the dynamically generated code was a real challenge. Especially in the presence of exceptions, tag-bodies, unwinds...</li>
					<li>I had to generate machine code that balanced low-level concerns like cache pressure, register pressure and branch prediction.</li>
					<li>As of winter 2008, the compiler is functional and in beta.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the autumn of 2007. Development is ongoing.<p>

				<h2>Game design</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>OpenGL, Java Swing, design patterns</p>
				<p>This was my second year project in university. We built a pinball game. At the beginning of the semester, we received the specification of a game we had to finish by ourselves by the end of the semester.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>We designed the architecture balancing diverse concerns.</li>
					<li>We used MVC. The model layer would be implemented by a C++ DLL and the View/Controller would be in Java.</li>
					<li>I understand the OpenGL pipeline.</li>
					<li>We implemented realistic physics.</li>
					<li>We implemented an editor that would allow the creation of game tables.</li>
					<li>My team was composed of 5 people.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the winter semester of 2008.<p>

				<h2>Python web programming</h2>
				<p><span class="quiet">Tags: </span>Django, Usability, Startups</p>
				<p>I developed a full featured dating website for a company I co-founded. We believed we could provide a better service because we understood how to make common use cases natural.<p>
				<ul>
					<li>I wanted this to be an introduction to the world of startups.</li>
					<li>I met weekly with my associate to assess progress and establish new tasks for the following week.</li>
					<li>We collaborated with a web designer for the graphical design.</li>
					<li>I wrote unit tests for all relevant functions.</li>
					<li>We used direct and indirect feedback from our end-users to help our decision making.</li>
					<li>I designed the interface to ease the common usage scenarios.</li>
					<li>I love Django.</li>
					<li>I returned to school at the end of the summer.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="quiet">Started in the summer of 2008.<p>
